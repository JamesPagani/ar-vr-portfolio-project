## About *Enigma*
Enigma is a Virtual Reality Puzzle game where the player has to explore through various rooms and finding the exit door in order to proceed to the next floor. Most of the times, you'll have to supply power to the exit door before you can proceed.

## Running the project
Since I did not manage to develop a standalone release, you'll have to open this project as a Unity (2020.3.2f1) project.

**THIS GAME WAS DEVELOPED ONLY FOR THE OCULUS QUEST 2**

1. Clone or Download this project.
2. Open Unity Hub
3. Add the project as a Unity project (If you don't have Unity 2020.3, download it before moving on).
4. Open up the project
5. Connect the Oculus Quest 2 to the computer
6. On the Unity Engine, go to Build Settings
7. Find the device (should either appear by its serial number or the device name)
8. Press "Build & Run"
